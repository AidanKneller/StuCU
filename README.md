# StuCU
CS 411 Project

StuCU is website for new and prospective UIUC students. Here, users can access links to a wide array of helpful resources that students might be interested in, from places to eat and clubs to join to companies to rent living space from and how to get in touch with advisors.

StuCU eliminates the difficulty of finding the exact resources you need, allowing students to access a set of UIUC-relevant information from one place.
